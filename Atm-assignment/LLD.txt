Low-Level Design (LLD):
The low-level design provides detailed information about the internal components and functions of the system.

1. Class Structure:
   - AccountHolder: Represents an account holder with properties for user ID and user PIN.
   - Account: Represents a bank account with properties for account number and balance. Provides methods for deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.
   - Bank: Manages accounts and account holders using arrays. Provides methods for adding account holders, creating accounts, retrieving accounts by user ID, and maintaining transaction history.
   - BankTransaction: Represents a bank transaction with properties for the account, transaction type, and amount.
   - ATM: Contains the main logic for the ATM system. Authenticates users, provides a menu, and interacts with the Bank for executing transactions and maintaining transaction history.
   - Main: Contains the main method to instantiate the Bank, Account Holders, and ATM objects. Also includes unit tests for various functionalities.

2. Functionality:
   - Account:
     - deposit(amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
     - withdraw(amount): Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance, if sufficient funds are available.
     - transfer(destinationAccount, amount): Transfers the specified amount from the current account to the destination account, if sufficient funds are available.

   - Bank:
     - addAccountHolder(index, accountHolder): Adds an account holder to the specified index of the accountHolders array.
     - createAccount(index, account): Creates an account and adds it to the specified index of the accounts array.
     - addTransaction(transaction): Adds a transaction to the transactions array.
     - getAccountByUserId(userId): Retrieves an account based on the user ID.
     - showTransactionHistory(account): Displays the transaction history for a given account.

   - ATM:
     - authenticateUser(userId, userPin): Authenticates the user based on the provided user ID and PIN.
     - showMenu(): Displays the ATM menu and handles user input to perform transactions.
     - start(): Entry point of the ATM system. Prompts for user ID and PIN, authenticates the user, and starts the menu if authentication is successful.

3. Unit Tests:
   - Test various functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, transfer, transaction history, and authentication.
   - Validate the expected results and ensure the correct functioning of the system.

The HLD and LLD provided above outline the overall structure and flow of the code, as well as the functionalities and interactions of the different classes and modules.
