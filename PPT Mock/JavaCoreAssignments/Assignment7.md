**Q1. What is the use of JDBC in Java?**

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that provides a set of classes and interfaces to connect and interact with relational databases. It allows Java applications to perform database operations such as connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, retrieving and updating data, and managing transactions. JDBC provides a standardized way to access databases, making it easier to develop database-driven applications in Java.

**Q2. What are the steps involved in JDBC?**

The steps involved in using JDBC to interact with a database are as follows:

1. Load the JDBC driver: Use the `Class.forName()` method to dynamically load the appropriate JDBC driver class.

2. Establish a connection: Use the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method to establish a connection to the database by providing the database URL, username, and password.

3. Create a statement: Create an instance of the `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` interface to execute SQL statements.

4. Execute the SQL statement: Use the `executeQuery()` method to retrieve data from the database or the `executeUpdate()` method to perform data manipulation operations.

5. Process the results: Iterate over the result set obtained from the executed SQL query and process the retrieved data.

6. Close the resources: Close the result set, statement, and connection objects to release any resources held by them.

**Q3. What are the types of statement in JDBC in Java?**

In JDBC, there are three types of statements:

1. Statement: The `Statement` interface is used to execute simple SQL statements without any parameters. It is suitable for executing static SQL queries or DDL statements.

2. PreparedStatement: The `PreparedStatement` interface is a precompiled SQL statement that can be executed multiple times with different parameter values. It is useful for executing parameterized SQL queries or DML statements.

3. CallableStatement: The `CallableStatement` interface is used to execute stored procedures or functions in the database. It can also be used to execute parameterized SQL queries or DML statements.

**Q4. What is Servlet in Java?**

A servlet is a Java program that runs on a web server and dynamically generates web content in response to client requests. It is a server-side component of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) platform. Servlets receive requests from clients (typically web browsers), process them, and generate dynamic HTML or other types of responses.

**Q5. Explain the life cycle of a servlet?**

The life cycle of a servlet consists of the following phases:

1. Initialization: The servlet container loads the servlet class and calls its `init()` method to initialize the servlet. This phase is executed only once during the lifetime of the servlet.

2. Handling Requests: The servlet container calls the `service()` method for each incoming request. The `service()` method determines the type of the request (GET, POST, etc.) and dispatches it to the appropriate method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc.) based on the HTTP request method.

3. Destroying: When the servlet container decides to remove the servlet from service, it calls the `destroy()` method of the servlet. This phase is executed only once during the lifetime of the servlet and is used to perform cleanup tasks.

**Q6. Explain the difference between the `RequestDispatcher.forward()` and `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()` methods?**

- `RequestDispatcher.forward()`: It is a method of the `RequestDispatcher` interface that forwards the request from one servlet to another resource (servlet, JSP, or HTML) on the server. The request and response objects are transferred to the destination resource, and the client is unaware of the forward. It is typically used for server-side forwarding within the same web application.

- `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()`: It is a method of the `HttpServletResponse` interface that sends a redirect response to the client. The client receives an HTTP redirect status (302 or 307) along with a new URL. The client then makes a new request to the specified URL. It is used to redirect the client to a different URL, possibly to another web application or external resource.

**Q7. What is the purpose of the `doGet()` and `doPost()` methods in a servlet?**

The `doGet()` and `doPost()` methods are two of the HTTP-specific methods defined in the `HttpServlet` class, which is a convenient base class for servlets that handle HTTP requests. The purpose of these methods is as follows:

- `doGet()`: It is called by the servlet container to handle an HTTP GET request. It is used to process requests that retrieve data or perform read-only operations. Typically, it is used to display information to the user or retrieve data from the server.

- `doPost()`: It is called by the servlet container to handle an HTTP POST request. It is used to process requests that submit data or perform write operations. Typically, it is used to send data from the client to the server, such as form submissions or data updates.

**Q

8. Explain the JSP Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.**

The JSP Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern used to separate the concerns of an application into three distinct components:

- Model: It represents the application's data and business logic. In the case of JSP, the model can be Java classes or JavaBeans that encapsulate the data and provide methods for manipulation.

- View: It represents the presentation layer of the application. In the case of JSP, the view is the JSP page that defines the structure and layout of the user interface. It is responsible for rendering the data received from the model.

- Controller: It handles the user's input and controls the flow of the application. In the case of JSP, the controller can be a servlet that receives the user's requests, interacts with the model to fetch or update data, and forwards the request to the appropriate JSP page for rendering.

The MVC architecture promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and reusability of components, making it easier to maintain and evolve the application.

**Q9. What are some advantages of Servlets?**

Some advantages of using Servlets in Java web development include:

- Portability: Servlets can run on any web server that supports the Java Servlet API, making them highly portable across different platforms and operating systems.

- Performance: Servlets are efficient in terms of resource usage and response time, as they can be precompiled and loaded into memory, avoiding the overhead of creating a new process for each request.

- Scalability: Servlets can handle a large number of concurrent requests and can be deployed in a clustered environment to achieve high scalability.

- Flexibility: Servlets provide a wide range of APIs and features for handling HTTP requests, session management, cookies, form processing, and more, allowing developers to build complex web applications.

- Integration: Servlets can easily integrate with other Java technologies such as JSP, JDBC, EJB, and frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, enabling developers to leverage the power of these technologies in web development.

**Q10. What are the limitations of JSP?**

Some limitations of JSP (JavaServer Pages) include:

- Complexity: JSP can become complex and hard to maintain when the logic and presentation code are mixed together in the same page. It is important to separate concerns and follow best practices to avoid this limitation.

- Performance: JSPs can have performance issues if not properly optimized. Excessive use of scriptlets or inefficient code can impact the response time of the application. Caching mechanisms and code optimizations are needed to mitigate these performance concerns.

- Learning Curve: JSP requires developers to have knowledge of Java programming and the web development concepts. It may have a learning curve for those new to Java web development.

- Limited Separation of Concerns: JSP tends to mix presentation logic with business logic, making it harder to achieve a clear separation of concerns. This can lead to decreased code reusability and maintainability.

- Limited Support for Asynchronous Processing: Traditional JSP has limited support for asynchronous processing, which can be a limitation when building highly responsive web applications. However, with the introduction of Servlet 3.0 and later versions, asynchronous processing is supported in JSP using Servlet APIs.

It's important to note that some of these limitations can be addressed using best practices, design patterns, and frameworks that enhance the capabilities of JSP, such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and the use of tag libraries.
