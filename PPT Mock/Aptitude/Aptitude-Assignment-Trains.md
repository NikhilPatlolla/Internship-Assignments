**Trains**
1. Two trains of length 125 meters and 115 meters are running on parallel tracks. When they run in the same direction, the faster train crosses the slower train in 30 seconds. Formula: Relative speed = (Length of faster train - Length of slower train) / Time taken
   Therefore, speed of faster train = (125 - 115) / 30 = 10 / 30 = 1/3 m/s
   Speed of slower train = speed of faster train - 1/3 = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0 m/s
   Answer: A. 18,6 (converting m/s to km/hr)

2. Two trains of length 140 meters and 166 meters are moving towards each other on parallel tracks. In what time the trains will cross each other from the moment they meet? Formula: Time taken = Total distance / Relative speed
   Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train = 140 + 166 = 306 meters
   Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train
                  = 50 km/hr + 60 km/hr = 110 km/hr
   Time taken = 306 / (110 * 5/18) = 9 seconds
   Answer: B. 9 seconds

3. Two trains running in opposite direction cross a man standing on the platform in 36 seconds and 26 seconds respectively. Formula: Ratio of speeds = Time taken by train 1 / Time taken by train 2
   Ratio of speeds = 36 / 26 = 18 / 13
   Answer: B. 3/9

4. A train of length 240 meters crosses a pole in 12 seconds. Formula: Speed = Distance / Time
   Speed = 240 / 12 = 20 m/s
   Time taken to cross the platform = (240 + 400) / 20 = 640 / 20 = 32 seconds
   Answer: D. 33 seconds

5. A train moving at 108 km/hr crosses a platform in 30 seconds. Formula: Speed = Distance / Time
   Speed = 108 * 5/18 = 30 m/s
   Let the length of the train be x meters and the length of the platform be y meters.
   Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of man = 30 - 12 = 18 m/s
   x + y = 18 * 9 = 162
   x + y = 162
   x + 400 = 162
   x = 162 - 400 = 238 meters
   Answer: A. 220 & 600

6. Two trains are moving towards each other with speeds 40 km/hr and 45 km/hr. Formula: Distance between the two stations = Distance covered by first train + Distance covered by second train
   Let the distance covered by the first train be x km.
   Distance covered by the second train = x + 20 km (as it covers 20 km more)
   x + (x + 20) = 40 * t + 45 * t (where t is the time taken in hours)
   2x + 20 = 85t
   x = 42.5t
   Distance between the two stations = 2x + 20 = 85t + 20
   Answer: B. 320 km

7. Time taken by two trains running in opposite directions to cross a man standing on the platform = 26 seconds. Formula: Ratio of speeds = Time taken by train 1 / Time taken by train 2
   Ratio of speeds = 28 / 18 = 14 / 9
   Answer: B. 3:2

8. A train moves past a telegraph post and a bridge 264 m long in 8 seconds and 20 seconds respectively. Formula: Speed = Distance / Time
   Let the speed of the train be x m/s.
   x = 264 / 8 = 33 m/s
   Converting m/s to km/hr: x * 18/5 = 33 * 18/5 = 118.8 km/hr
   Answer: C. 79 km/hr

9.  Two trains of equal length pass a pole in 18 and 12 seconds. Formula: Time taken to cross each other = Time taken to pass pole / Relative speed
    Relative speed = (2 * Length of one train) / Time taken to pass pole
    Relative speed = (2 * Length of one train) / (18 - 12) = (2 * Length of one train) / 6
    Time taken to cross each other = 6 seconds
    Answer: C. 18.8 sec

10. A 270 meters long train running at the speed of 120 kmph crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 kmph in 9 seconds. Formula: Length of the other train = Relative speed * Time taken to cross
    Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train = 120 + 80 = 200 kmph
    Length of the other train = 200 * (9 * 5/18) = 500 meters
    Answer: D. 320 m

11. Two stations P and Q are 110 km apart. Formula: Time taken = Distance / Relative speed
    Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train = 20 kmph + 25 kmph = 45 kmph
    Time taken = 110 / 45 = 2.44 hours
    Convert to minutes: 0.44 * 60 = 26.4 minutes
    Answer: D. 9:30

12. A train covers a distance between station A and station B in 45 min. If the speed of the train is reduced by 5 km/hr, then the same distance is covered in 48 min. Formula: Distance = Speed * Time
    Let the distance between station A

 and station B be x km.
    Speed of the train = x / (45/60) = 4x/3 km/hr
    Speed of the train (reduced) = x / (48/60) = 5x/4 km/hr
    4x/3 - 5x/4 = 5
    16x - 15x = 60
    x = 60 km
    Answer: C. 60

14. A train travels the distance between stations P and Q at a speed of 126 km/h, while in the opposite direction it comes back at 90 km/h. Formula: Time = Distance / Speed
    Let the distance between stations P and Q be x km.
    Time taken in one direction = x / 126 hours
    Time taken in the opposite direction = x / 90 hours
    Total time taken = x / 126 + x / 90 = 525 / 60
    15x + 21x = 525
    36x = 525
    x = 14.58 km (approx)
    Time taken by the second train = Distance / Speed = 14.58 / 126 = 0.1155 hours = 4 hours 20 min
    Answer: C. 4 hours 20 min

15. For a train without stoppage, average speed = 72 km/h. With stoppage, average speed = 60 km/h. Formula: Time spent on stoppage per hour = (Average speed without stoppage - Average speed with stoppage) / Average speed without stoppage * 60
    Time spent on stoppage per hour = (72 - 60) / 72 * 60 = 8 minutes
    Answer: B. 8
