**Permutations and Combinations**


1. A round table conference is to be held among 25 delegates from 25 countries. In how many ways can they be seated if two particular delegates are always to sit together?
   Answer: B. 2! × 23!
   Explanation: Treat the two particular delegates as one entity, so we have 24 entities to arrange in a circular manner. The remaining 23 delegates can be arranged among themselves in 23! ways. However, the two particular delegates within the entity can be arranged in 2! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 2! × 23!.

2. In how many ways can 5 boys and 4 girls be seated in a row, so that they alternate?
   Answer: B. 5! × 2!
   Explanation: The boys and girls can be arranged alternately. First, arrange the 5 boys among themselves in 5! ways. Then, arrange the 4 girls among themselves in 4! ways. Since the boys and girls can be interchanged, we multiply the two arrangements to get the total number of ways, which is 5! × 4!.

3. In how many ways can the letters of the word 'LEADER' be arranged?
   Answer: D. 720
   Explanation: The word 'LEADER' has 6 letters. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters is 6!, which is equal to 720.

4. A box contains 2 white balls, 3 black balls, and 4 red balls. In how many ways can 3 balls be drawn from the box, if at least one black ball is to be included in the draw?
   Answer: D. 96
   Explanation: There are three cases to consider: 
   1) One black ball and two balls of different colors: Choose one black ball from the 3 black balls and choose two balls from the remaining 6 balls (2 white + 4 red). This can be done in C(3,1) × C(6,2) = 3 × 15 = 45 ways.
   2) Two black balls and one ball of a different color: Choose two black balls from the 3 black balls and choose one ball from the remaining 6 balls. This can be done in C(3,2) × C(6,1) = 3 × 6 = 18 ways.
   3) Three black balls: Choose three black balls from the 3 black balls. This can be done in C(3,3) = 1 way.
   The total number of ways is 45 + 18 + 1 = 64 ways.

5. How many numbers greater than a million can be formed with the digits 2, 3, 0, 4, 3, 3?
   Answer: C. 440
   Explanation: Since the number has to be greater than a million, the first digit can only be 2, 3, or 4. The remaining digits can be arranged in 5!/(2! × 3!) = 10 ways. Therefore, the total number of numbers is 3 × 10 = 30. However, the number 2,033,433 is not greater than a million. So, subtracting 1 from the total, we get 30 - 1 = 29 numbers. Hence, the answer is 29 + 1 = 30.

6. A gentleman has got 6 sorts of note papers, 7 different ink-stands, and 4 different pens. In how many ways can he begin to write a letter?
   Answer: C. 186
   Explanation: The gentleman can choose any of the 6 note papers, any of the 7 ink-stands, and any of the 4 pens. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6 × 7 × 4 = 168.

7. How many different words can be formed from the alphabets of the word SCISSORS?
   Answer: B. 1680
   Explanation: The word SCISSORS has 8 letters, including 3 S's and 2 I's. Therefore, the number of different words that can be formed is 8!/(3! × 2!) = 1680.

8. A team of 8 students goes on an excursion, in two cars, of which one can seat 5 and the other only 4. In how many ways can they travel?
   Answer: D. 3920
   Explanation: The 8 students can be divided into two groups of 5 and 3. The group of 5 can be chosen in C(8,5) = 56 ways. For the group of 3, they can be chosen in C(3,3) = 1 way. Therefore, the total number of ways is 56 × 1 = 56.

9. How many ways can 10 letters be posted in 5 post boxes, if each of the post boxes can take more than 10 letters?
   Answer: A. 510
   Explanation: Each letter can be placed in any of the 5 post boxes. Therefore, for each letter, there are 5 choices. Since there are 10 letters, the total number of ways is 5^10 = 9765625. However, we subtract the case where all letters are in one box (5 choices). Hence, the answer is 9765625 - 5 = 9765620.

10. In how many ways can 15 people be seated around two round tables with seating capacities of 7 and 8 people?
    Answer: C. (15C8) × 6! × 7!
    Explanation: Choose 8 people out of 15 to be seated at the first table in C(15,8) ways. The remaining 7 people will be seated at the second table. Now, arrange the 8 people at the first table in 8! ways and arrange the 7 people at the second table in 7! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is C(15,8) × 8! × 7!.

11. In how many ways can the letters of the word EDUCATION be rearranged so that the relative position of the vowels and consonants remain the same as in the word EDUCATION?
    Answer: B. 9!/(4! × 5!)
    Explanation: The word EDUCATION has 5 vowels (E, U, A, I, O) and 4 consonants (D, C, T, N). The vowels can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, and the consonants can be arranged among themselves in 4! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 5! × 4!. However, since the vowels and consonants are fixed in their relative positions, we divide by the number of ways they can be arranged within their respective groups, which is 4! for the vowels and 5! for the consonants.

12. There are 2 brothers among a group of 20 persons. In how many ways can the group be arranged around a circle so that there is exactly one person between the two brothers?
    Answer: D. 2 × 18!
    Explanation: Consider the two brothers as a single entity. We have 

19 entities (18 remaining people + 1 entity for the two brothers) to arrange in a circle. The two brothers within the entity can be arranged in 2! ways. The remaining 18 entities can be arranged in 18! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 2 × 18!.

13. A selection is to be made for one post of principal and two posts of vice-principal amongst the six candidates called for the interview. Only two are eligible for the post of principal, while they all are eligible for the post of vice-principal. The number of possible combinations of selectees is:
    Answer: B. 12
    Explanation: The post of principal can be filled in 2 ways (since only two are eligible). The two posts of vice-principal can be filled in C(4,2) = 6 ways (since four candidates are eligible, excluding the two eligible for the post of principal). Therefore, the total number of combinations is 2 × 6 = 12.

14. In how many different ways can five friends sit for a photograph of five chairs in a row?
    Answer: A. 120 ways
    Explanation: The first friend has 5 choices for the first chair, the second friend has 4 choices for the second chair, and so on. Therefore, the total number of ways is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways.

15. In a room, there are 12 bulbs of the same wattage, each having a separate switch. The number of ways to light the room with different amounts of illumination is:
    Answer: C. 2^12 - 1
    Explanation: Each bulb can be either on or off, so there are 2 choices for each bulb. However, we subtract 1 because the case of all bulbs being off is not allowed. Therefore, the total number of ways is 2^12 - 1.
