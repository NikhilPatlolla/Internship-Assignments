**Probability**


1. Two cards are drawn at random from a pack of cards. The probability that both are queens or diamonds is:
   Answer: C. 13/221
   Explanation: There are 4 queens and 13 diamonds in a pack of cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a queen as the first card is 4/52, and the probability of drawing a queen as the second card, given that the first card was a queen, is 3/51. Similarly, the probability of drawing a diamond as the first card is 13/52, and the probability of drawing a diamond as the second card, given that the first card was a diamond, is 12/51. Adding these probabilities, we get (4/52) × (3/51) + (13/52) × (12/51) = 13/221.

2. From a bag containing 6 pink and 8 orange balls, 8 balls are drawn at random. The probability that 5 of them are pink and the rest are orange is:
   Answer: C. 17/143
   Explanation: The total number of ways to select 8 balls from 14 balls (6 pink + 8 orange) is C(14,8) = 3003. The number of ways to select 5 pink balls and 3 orange balls is C(6,5) × C(8,3) = 6 × 56 = 336. Therefore, the probability is 336/3003 = 56/501 = 17/143.

3. From a box containing a dozen bulbs, of which exactly one half are good, and four bulbs are chosen at random to fit into the four bulb holders in a room. The probability that the room gets lighted is:
   Answer: D. 32/33
   Explanation: The number of ways to select 4 bulbs from 12 bulbs is C(12,4) = 495. The number of ways to select 4 good bulbs from 6 good bulbs is C(6,4) = 15. Therefore, the probability is 15/495 = 1/33. Since there are 4 bulb holders, the probability that all 4 bulbs fit into the holders is (1/33)^4 = 1/33^4 = 1/1185921. The probability that the room gets lighted is 1 - 1/1185921 = 1185920/1185921 = 32/33.

4. If 10 letters are to be placed in 10 addressed envelopes, then what is the probability that at least one letter is placed in the wrong addressed envelope?
   Answer: D. 9/10
   Explanation: The total number of ways to arrange the letters in the envelopes is 10! = 3628800. The number of ways to arrange the letters such that each letter goes into the correctly addressed envelope is 1. Therefore, the probability that at least one letter is placed in the wrong addressed envelope is 1 - 1/3628800 = 1 - 1/10! = 1 - 1/362880 = 1 - 1/36288 = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10.

5. I select three numbers randomly from 1 to 10. What is the probability that their product is an odd number?
   Answer: B. 1/2
   Explanation: An odd number can be obtained when at least one odd number is selected from the three numbers. Since half of the numbers from 1 to 10 are odd (5 out of 10), the probability of selecting at least one odd number is 1 - probability of selecting all even numbers. The probability of selecting all even numbers is (5/10) × (4/9) × (3/8) = 1/12. Therefore, the probability of selecting at least one odd number is 1 - 1/12 = 11/12. However, we need to consider that the product of three even numbers is also an even number. Therefore, the probability of selecting three even numbers is (5/10) × (4/9) × (3/8) = 1/12. Subtracting this probability from 1, we get 1 - 1/12 = 11/12. Hence, the probability that their product is an odd number is 11/12.

6. Ramesh has a garments shop. He currently has 6 black, 4 red, 2 white, and 3 blue shirts of the same size in stock. He picks 2 shirts randomly for display. What is the probability that either both shirts are white or blue?
   Answer: A. 1/105
   Explanation: The total number of ways to select 2 shirts from 15 shirts is C(15,2) = 105. The number of ways to select 2 white shirts from 2 white shirts is C(2,2) = 1. The number of ways to select 2 blue shirts from 3 blue shirts is C(3,2) = 3. Therefore, the probability is (1 + 3)/105 = 4/105 = 1/26.

7. There are 6 oranges, 2 pink, 4 yellow, and 3 green towels in a carton. What is the probability of picking up 2 orange towels randomly?
   Answer: C. 2/7
   Explanation: The total number of ways to select 2 towels from 15 towels is C(15,2) = 105. The number of ways to select 2 orange towels from 6 orange towels is C(6,2) = 15. Therefore, the probability is 15/105 = 1/7.

8. In a bag are

 10 red balls and 16 green balls. If two balls are drawn one after the other without replacement, what is the probability that the first is "red" while the second one is "green"?
   Answer: B. 35/134
   Explanation: The probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 10/26. After drawing a red ball, there are 9 red balls and 16 green balls remaining in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a green ball on the second draw, given that the first ball was red, is 16/25. Multiplying these probabilities, we get (10/26) × (16/25) = 160/650 = 16/65. However, we need to consider that the first ball could also be green and the second ball red. The probability of drawing a green ball on the first draw is 16/26. After drawing a green ball, there are 10 red balls and 15 green balls remaining in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw, given that the first ball was green, is 10/25. Multiplying these probabilities, we get (16/26) × (10/25) = 160/650 = 16/65. Adding these two probabilities, we get 16/65 + 16/65 = 32/65 = 35/134.

9. One card is drawn at random from a pack of 52 cards. What is the probability that the card drawn is a face card (Jack, Queen, and King only)?
   Answer: A. 3/13
   Explanation: There are 12 face cards (4 Jacks + 4 Queens + 4 Kings) in a pack of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a face card is 12/52 = 3/13.

10. X attempts 94 questions and gets 141 marks. If for every correct answer 4 marks are given, and for every wrong answer 1 mark is deducted, then the number of questions wrongly answered by X is __.
    Answer: C. 57
    Explanation: Let the number of correct answers be x. The number of wrong answers is 94 - x. The total marks obtained can be expressed as 4x - (94 - x) = 141. Solving this equation, we get x = 57. Therefore, the number of questions wrongly answered is 94 - 57 = 37.

11. Find the probability of selecting 2 women when four persons are chosen at random from a group of 3 men, 2 women, and 4 children.
    Answer: B. 1/6
    Explanation: The total number of ways to select 4 persons from 9 persons is C(9,4) = 126. The number of ways to select 2 women and 2 other persons (men or children) is C(2,2) × C(7,2) = 1 × 21 = 21. Therefore, the probability is 21/126 = 1/6.

12. What is the probability that it is either a heart card or a diamond card when a card is drawn from a well-shuffled standard pack of 52 playing cards?
    Answer: D. 1/3
    Explanation: There are 13 heart cards and 13 diamond cards in a standard pack of 52 playing cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a heart card or a diamond card is (13 + 13)/52 = 26/52 = 1/2. However, we need to subtract the probability of drawing both a heart card and a diamond card, which is 0 since a card cannot be both a heart card and a diamond card. Therefore, the final probability is 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.

13. In a single throw with 2 dice, what is the probability of neither getting an even number on one die nor a multiple of 3 on the other die?
    Answer: A. 11/36
    Explanation: The total number of outcomes when throwing 2 dice is 6 × 6 = 36. The number of outcomes where neither die shows an even number is 3 × 3 = 9 (1, 3, 5 on the first die, and 1, 3, 5 on the second die). The number of outcomes where neither die shows a multiple of 3 is 4 × 4 = 16 (1, 2, 4, 5 on the first die, and 1, 2, 4, 5 on the second die). The number of outcomes where neither condition is satisfied is the intersection of these two sets, which is 2 × 2 = 4 (1, 5 on the first die, and 1, 5 on the second die). Therefore, the probability is 4/36 = 1/9.

14. Let K and L be events on the same sample space, with P(K) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.6. Are these two events being disjoint?
    Answer: B. False
    Explanation: Two events are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set. In this case, we do not have information about the intersection of events K and L, so we cannot determine if they are disjoint or not.

15. Tickets numbered 1 to 20 are mixed up, and then a ticket is drawn at random. What is the probability that the ticket drawn has a number which is a multiple of 4 or 15?
    Answer: C. 7/10
    Explanation: The total number of tickets is 20. The number of tickets that are multiples of 4 or 15 is 5 (4, 8, 12, 15, 16). Therefore, the probability is 5/20 = 1/4.
