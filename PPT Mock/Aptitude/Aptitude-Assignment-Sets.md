1. In the Mindworkzz club, all the members participate either in the Tambola or the Fete. 320 participate in the Fete, 350 participate in the Tambola, and 220 participate in both. How many members does the club have?
   Answer: C. 440
   Explanation: We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. The total number of members in the club is the sum of the members participating in the Fete and the members participating in the Tambola, minus the members participating in both. Therefore, the total number of members is 320 + 350 - 220 = 450.

2. There are 20000 people living in Defence Colony, Gurgaon. Out of them, 9000 subscribe to the Star TV Network and 12000 to the Zee TV Network. If 4000 subscribe to both, how many do not subscribe to any of the two?
   Answer: B. 2000
   Explanation: The number of people who subscribe to either the Star TV Network or the Zee TV Network is the sum of the subscribers to each network minus the number of people who subscribe to both networks. Therefore, the number of people who subscribe to either network is 9000 + 12000 - 4000 = 17000. The number of people who do not subscribe to any of the two networks is the total population minus the number of people who subscribe to either network, which is 20000 - 17000 = 3000.

3. In the Indian athletic squad sent to the Olympics, 21 athletes were in the triathlon team, 26 were in the pentathlon team, and 29 were in the marathon team. 14 athletes can take part in both triathlon and pentathlon, 12 can take part in both marathon and triathlon, 15 can take part in both pentathlon and marathon, and 8 can take part in all three games. How many were in the marathon team only?
   Answer: D. 9
   Explanation: We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. The total number of athletes in the squad is the sum of the athletes in each individual team, minus the athletes who can take part in multiple teams, plus the athletes who can take part in all three teams. Therefore, the total number of athletes is 21 + 26 + 29 - (14 + 12 + 15) + 8 = 43. The number of athletes in the marathon team only is the total number of athletes minus the athletes who can take part in both the marathon and other teams, which is 43 - (12 + 15 - 8) = 34 - 17 = 17 - 9 = 9.

4. 5% of the passengers who boarded Guwahati-New Delhi Rajdhani Express on 20th February 2002 do not like coffee, tea, and ice cream, and 10% like all three. 20% like coffee and tea, 25% like ice cream and coffee, and 25% like ice cream and tea. 55% like coffee, 50% like tea, and 50% like ice cream. The number of passengers who like only coffee is greater than the passengers who like only ice cream by
   Answer: C. 50
   Explanation: We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. Let C represent the set of passengers who like coffee, T represent the set of passengers who like tea, and I represent the set of passengers who like ice cream. The number of passengers who like only coffee is |C| - |C ∩ T| - |C ∩ I| + |C ∩ T ∩ I|. Similarly, the number of passengers who like only ice cream is |I| - |C ∩ I| - |T ∩ I| + |C ∩ T ∩ I|. We are given that |C ∩ T ∩ I| = 10% of the total number of passengers, which is 0.10 * total passengers. The difference between the number of passengers who like only coffee and the number of passengers who like only ice cream is |C| - |I| = 55% of the total passengers - 50% of the total passengers = 0.55 * total passengers - 0.50 * total passengers = 0.05 * total passengers. Since |C ∩ T| = 20% of the total passengers, |C ∩ I| = 25% of the total passengers, and |T ∩ I| = 25% of the total passengers, we can substitute these values into the equations to solve for the number of passengers who like only coffee and the number of passengers who like only ice cream. The difference between these two numbers is 0.05 * total passengers, which is equal to 50% of the total passengers. Therefore, the answer is 50.

5. In the given Venn diagram, A denotes mangoes, B denotes bananas, C denotes apples, and the numbers in each section represent the number of persons who like those fruits. How many persons like only bananas?
   Answer: C. 31
   Explanation: To find the number of persons who like only bananas, we need to subtract the number of persons who like bananas and another fruit from the total number of persons who like bananas. From the diagram, we can see that 31 persons like both bananas and apples. Therefore, the number of persons who like only bananas is 65 - 31 = 34.

6. In a group of 75 students, 12 like only cabbage, 15 like only cauliflower, 21 like only carrot, 12 like both carrot and cabbage, 13 like only capsicum, and 2 like both capsicum and cauliflower. What is the percentage of students that do not like cabbage?
   Answer: C. 24%
   Explanation: To find the percentage of students who do not like cabbage, we need to subtract the number of students who like cabbage from the total number of students and then calculate the percentage. The total number of students is 75. The number of students who like cabbage is 12, so the number of students who do not like cabbage is 75 - 12 = 63. The percentage of students who do not like cabbage is (63/75) * 100% = 84%.

7. In the given diagram, the circle stands for 'farmers', the rectangle stands for 'rural', and the triangle stands for 'rich'. The numbers given in the different segments represent the number of persons of that category. How many rural people are either farmers or rich but NOT both?
   Answer: B. 12
   Explanation: To find the number of rural people who are either farmers or rich but not both, we need to add the number of rural farmers and the number of rural rich people and then subtract twice the number of rural people who are both farmers and rich. From the diagram, we can see that there are 15 rural farmers, 16 rural rich people, and 7 rural people who are both farmers and rich. Therefore, the number of rural people who are either farmers or rich but not both is 15 + 16 - (2 * 7) = 15 + 16 - 14 = 17 - 14 = 3.

8. In a batch of 68 students, 23 students do not participate in any of the two games, i.e. cricket and squash. 17 students participate in cricket only, 24 students participate in cricket and squash. How many students participate in squash only?
   Answer: D. 20
   Explanation: To find the number of students who participate in squash only, we need to subtract the number of students who participate in both cricket and squash from the total number of students who participate in squash. From the given information, we know that 24 students participate in cricket and squash, and 17 students participate in cricket only. Therefore, the number of students who participate in squash only is 68 - 24 - 17 = 27 - 17 = 10.

9. Among 160 players in a tournament, 57 did not participate in any of the three games, i.e. Cricket, Hockey, and Badminton. A total of 37 players participated in only one game, 10 players participated in both Cricket and Hockey but not in Badminton, 9 players participated in both Hockey and Badminton but not in Cricket, and 13 players participated in both Cricket and Badminton but not in Hockey. How many students participated in all three games?
   Answer: A. 30
   Explanation: To find the number of students who participated in all three games, we need to subtract the number of players who participated in none of the three games and the number of players who participated in only one game from the total number of players. From the given information, we know that 57 players did not participate in any of the three games, and 37 players participated in only one game. Therefore, the number of players who participated in all three games is 160 - 57 - 37 = 66 - 37 = 29.

10. In a class of 100 students, every student has passed in one or more of the three subjects, i.e. History, Economics, and English. Among all the students, 24 students have passed in English only, 14 students have passed in History only, 11 students have passed in both English and Economics only, and 12 students have passed in both English and History only. A total of 50 students have passed in History. If only 5 students have passed in all three subjects, then how many students have passed in Economics only?
    Answer: A. 15
    Explanation: To find the number of students who have passed in Economics only, we need to subtract the number of students who have passed in Economics and other

 subjects from the total number of students who have passed in Economics. From the given information, we know that 11 students have passed in both English and Economics only, and 5 students have passed in all three subjects. Therefore, the number of students who have passed in Economics only is 50 - 11 - 5 = 39 - 5 = 34.

11. Select the Venn diagram that best illustrates the relationship between the following classes: Graduates, Teachers, Literates
    Answer: C. C
    Explanation: In the Venn diagram, C represents the circle for Literates, G represents the circle for Graduates, and T represents the circle for Teachers. The diagram shows that all Teachers are Graduates (T is completely inside G), and all Graduates are Literates (G is completely inside C). This represents the correct relationship between the three classes.

12. Find the solution set of the equation x^2 + x + 2 = 0 in roster form
    Answer: B. {}
    Explanation: The equation x^2 + x + 2 = 0 does not have real solutions. Therefore, the solution set is empty, represented by the empty set {}.

13. 60 students participated in one or more of the three competitions, i.e. Quiz, Extempore, and Debate. A total of 22 students participated either in Quiz only or in Extempore only. 4 students participated in all three competitions. A total of 14 students participated in any of the two competitions only. How many students participated in Debate only?
    Answer: A. 11
    Explanation: To find the number of students who participated in Debate only, we need to subtract the number of students who participated in Quiz, Extempore, or both from the total number of students who participated in Debate, Quiz, Extempore, or any combination. From the given information, we know that 60 students participated in one or more competitions, 22 students participated in Quiz only or Extempore only, and 4 students participated in all three competitions. Therefore, the number of students who participated in Debate only is 60 - 22 - 14 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16.

14. Identify the diagram that best represents the relationship among the given classes: Country, State, City
    Answer: B. 2
    Explanation: In diagram 2, the circle represents Country, the rectangle represents State, and the triangle represents City. The diagram shows that all Cities are within States (triangle is completely inside the rectangle), and all States are within Country (rectangle is completely inside the circle). This represents the correct relationship between the three classes.

15. Convert the set A = {3, -3} into set-builder form
    Answer: D. None of these
    Explanation: The set A = {3, -3} cannot be expressed in set-builder form because it does not follow a specific pattern or condition. The set-builder form is used to represent sets based on a specific rule or condition, but in this case, the set A simply contains the elements 3 and -3 without any specific pattern or condition.

16. Set P comprises all multiples of 4 less than 500. Set Q comprises all odd multiples of 7 less than 500. Set R comprises all multiples of 6 less than 500. How many elements are present in P∪Q∪R?
    Answer: B. 243
    Explanation: To find the number of elements present in P∪Q∪R, we need to find the union of sets P, Q, and R, which is the set of all elements that are present in at least one of the three sets. Set P contains all multiples of 4 less than 500, which is 500/4 = 125 elements. Set Q contains all odd multiples of 7 less than 500, which is 500/7 = 71 elements. Set R contains all multiples of 6 less than 500, which is 500/6 = 83 elements. To find the number of elements in P∪Q∪R, we can add the number of elements in each set and then subtract the number of elements that are common to two or more sets. However, since the sets P, Q, and R are not mutually exclusive (they have some elements in common), we need to be careful in counting the common elements. In this case, the only common multiple of 4, 7, and 6 less than 500 is 84. Therefore, the number of elements in P∪Q∪R is 125 + 71 + 83 - 1 = 278.

17. Of 60 students in a class, anyone who has chosen to study math elects to do physics as well. But no one does math and chemistry, 16 do physics only, and 24 do physics and chemistry. All the students do at least one of the three subjects, and the number of people who do exactly one of the three is more than the number who do more than one of the three. What are the maximum and minimum numbers of people who could have done Chemistry only?
    Answer: A. 40, 0
    Explanation: To determine the maximum and minimum numbers of people who could have done Chemistry only, we need to consider the given conditions. Since no one does math and chemistry, the maximum number of people who could have done Chemistry only is the total number of students minus the number of students who do math and physics only, which is 60 - 16 = 44. On the other hand, since the number of people who do exactly one of the three subjects is more than the number who do more than one of the three, the minimum number of people who could have done Chemistry only is 0, as there could be no students who only studied Chemistry. Therefore, the maximum number of people who could have done Chemistry only is 40, and the minimum number is 0.

18. Of the members of three athletic teams in a school, 21 are in the cricket team, 26 are in the hockey team, and 29 are in the football team. Among them, 14 play hockey and cricket, 15 play hockey and football, and 12 play football and cricket. Eight play all three games. The total number of members in the three athletic teams is
    Answer: D. None of these
    Explanation: To find the total number of members in the three athletic teams, we need to add the number of members in each individual team and then subtract the number of members who play multiple teams, as we would otherwise count them multiple times. From the given information, we know that 21 members are in the cricket team, 26 members are in the hockey team, and 29 members are in the football team. However, we also know that some members play multiple teams, which means they are counted in more than one team. Since we are not given the exact numbers for members who play multiple teams, we cannot determine the total number of members in the three athletic teams.

19. The set of intelligent students in a class is
    Answer: (d) Not a well-defined collection
    Explanation: The statement "The set of intelligent students in a class" does not provide a clear and well-defined criterion for determining which students are considered intelligent. Without a specific definition or criteria for intelligence

, the set cannot be defined.

20. In a class of 30 pupils, 12 take needlework, 16 take physics, and 18 take history. If all the 30 students take at least one subject and no one takes all three, then the number of pupils taking 2 subjects is
    Answer: (c) 8
    Explanation: To find the number of pupils taking 2 subjects, we need to count the number of students who take exactly 2 subjects (not including those who take all three subjects). From the given information, we know that 12 students take needlework, 16 students take physics, and 18 students take history. Since all 30 students take at least one subject and no one takes all three, we can subtract the total number of students from the sum of students taking each individual subject to find the number of students taking exactly 2 subjects. Therefore, the number of pupils taking 2 subjects is 30 - (12 + 16 + 18) = 30 - 46 = -16. However, since the number of students cannot be negative, the correct answer is 0.
